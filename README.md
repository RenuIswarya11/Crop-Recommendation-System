ðŸ“– Introduction

The Crop Recommendation System leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze various parameters such as soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. By processing this data, the system predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate in a given area, thereby enhancing agricultural productivity.â€‹
